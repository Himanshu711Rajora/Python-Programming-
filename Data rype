Data type: In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types, in these categories:
1. Numeric data type:
      . integer
      . float
      . Boolean
      . Complex
2. sequence data type:
      .  Staring
      . Tuple
      . List

3. Dictionary  data type:
      .  Key/value

4. set
      .  set(frozen sets)


Mutable or imutable data type both are important for data type
1. Mutable: mutable variables can change their value after creation.
    like: Sets, Dictionary, Set

2. Imutable:immutable variables cannot.
    Like: Nueric, string, Tuple, frozen sets.
